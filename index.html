      <p>We are a group of experienced IT engineers who specialise in building distributed web and mobile systems. We are passionate technology craftsmen but our passion is a side effect of mastery. We are programmers, system administrators, dev ops and, generally, problem solvers. We are Laatu. Today's world is a digital world. Innovations and technology advances have totally changed everyone's life. That's why, while being part of it since the 90's, quality and security have become most important to us. During our careers, we have worked on developing and maintaining management systems for national healthcare, education, call centers, print houses, digital agencies and many more.</p>
